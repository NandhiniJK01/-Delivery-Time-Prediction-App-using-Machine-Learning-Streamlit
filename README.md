# 📦 Delivery Time Prediction App

This project is a machine learning-powered Streamlit web app that predicts **estimated delivery time** based on two key input features:
- 📏 Delivery Distance (in km)
- 🏋️ Package Weight (in kg)

### 🔧 Tech Stack:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Streamlit (for UI)

### 🧠 ML Model:
A Linear Regression model trained on dummy data to map the relationship between distance, weight, and delivery time.

### 🚀 Features:
- Real-time predictions
- Simple and responsive UI via Streamlit
- Easy deployment to Streamlit Cloud
